      "Information displayed in an analytics board corresponds to a snapshot of Wrike workspace data, which is made daily after 8 p.m. in the timezone of the account owner. You can see the actual time of the snapshot within the top bar of an analytics board.\n",
      "You can't create analytics boards based on folders, projects, or spaces created less than 24 hours ago.\n",
      "The “Include data from” filter always needs to be populated to avoid errors and incorrect results in widgets.\n",
      "Custom fields that are not shared with everyone in the account are unavailable in analytics.\n",
      "Custom fields that are not numeric/currency/percentage cannot be added as columns to Pivot widgets\n",
      "There is no way to filter an analytics board using two different custom fields at once. To filter over a single custom field, select two filters: with custom field name and required value(s). You can create two different widgets, each filtering for a specific custom field.\n",
      "Wrike Analyze is not available on accounts encrypted with Wrike Lock.\n",
      "For the best performance, it's recommended to have no more than 8 widgets per board.\n",

      "Pivot: This one might be the most useful for summarizing and analyzing large amounts of data.\n",
      "Pie Chart: Use Pie Chart to display proportional data, and/or percentages.\n",
      "Column Chart: The Column Chart can be used for comparing items and comparing data over time. The chart can include multiple values on both the X and Y-axis.\n",
      "Bar Chart: Use Bar Chart to compare many items. You can see descriptive data (e.g. categories or items) along the Y-Axis and values displayed on the X-Axis.\n",
      "Line Chart: Use Line Chart to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group or category.\n",
      "Area Chart: This one is very similar to the Line Chart except that the areas under each line are colored, and it is possible to display them as stacked.\n",
      "Table: Table widget displays a broader view of your data, presenting it in columns.\n",
      "Tree Map: The Tree Map is a multi-dimensional widget that displays hierarchical data in the form of nested rectangles.\n",
      "Scatter Map: Use Scatter Maps to visualize geographical data as data points on a map. The map distinguishes data using different colors and sizes for the data points on the map.\n",
      "Area Map: Area Map shows the locations of data, selected for the widget.\n",
      "Indicator: The Indicator widget provides various options for displaying one or two numeric values as a number, gauge or ticker. It also provides the option to add additional titles and a color-coded indicator icon representing the value.\n",
      "Scatter Chart: The Scatter Chart displays the distribution of two variables on an X-Axis, Y-Axis, and two additional dimensions of data that are shown as colored circles scattered across the chart.\n",
      "Calendar Heatmap: Use the Calendar Heatmap widget to visualize values over days in a calendar-like view.\n",
      "Sunburst: The Sunburst widget is similar to a Pie Chart but is multi-dimensional. Whereas a pie chart combines one field and one numeric value, the Sunburst widget can display multiple rings, one for each field.\n",
      "Box & Whisker Plot: Box Plots are divided into four quartiles. The middle quartiles are represented by a box that contains 50% of the data and the median value. The upper and lower quartiles contain the maximum and minimum values and the remaining 50% of the data. These quartiles are represented by lines called whiskers.\n",
      "Polar Chart: Use the Polar Chart to compare multiple categories/variables with a spacial perspective.\n",
      "Funnel Chart: Funnel Chart is a common way to show stages in a process, with the most prevalent example being a funnel representing stages in a sales process.\n",

If you don’t use a sync account, then GitHub will show that the user, whose credentials you selected to set up the sync, updated the issue.  To create a sync account, create a new GitHub user and name it “Wrike Bot.” Visit Unito’s help center to read more about what permissions the Wrike Bot account requires.

In each case, you’re looking at the same tasks but from different angles.\n",

For example, you can set your filters to see tasks that are completed, assigned to a certain person, and scheduled for this week. You can slice and dice your data exactly the way you need by applying several filters and saving the selected configuration as a preset.

      "To get started, use one of these rules of thumb for setting up your space structure. You can always change it later to fit your team processes better:\n",
      "\n",

      "Setting up folder structure\n",
      "Folders help you categorize your tasks and projects in Spaces, such as by region, type of work, sprint, etc. Also, folders can be used as tags to categorize your tasks or projects for quick access, since a task can be placed in several folders at once. You can color-code folder names so your tags stand out visually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wrike Tip: We strongly recommend adding the following folders to your account:\n",
      "Archive folder: Use this folder to store completed or outdated work items. Learn more Knowledge Base folder: Fill this folder with tasks containing rules of using Wrike and answers to most frequent questions your team may have. Learn more Templates folder: Add folder and project templates here. Create a subfolder to store individual task templates. If you are on a Business and above subscription, we recommend to enable Blueprints in Labs.

      "\n",
      "Create a project by clicking the “+” button. Fill out the project title, due dates, and project owner and choose the default view for your tasks (List, Board, Table, or Gantt Chart).\n",
      "Populate it with tasks. Think of tasks as action items that should be completed in order to achieve a project goal.\n",

      "Schedule the tasks one by one or by using mass editing.\n",
      "Switch to the Gantt Chart to visualize your schedule. Make sure that you’ve set up correct durations for each task and reschedule tasks if needed.\n",
      "Set up dependencies. Dependencies help you understand how tasks are interconnected. When you reschedule a task with dependencies, all dependent tasks are automatically rescheduled. When the task is completed, the assignee of the dependent task receives a notification that they may start working on their task.\n",

      "You’ve spent some time choosing the best solution for managing your team’s work, learned all the ins and outs, and set up processes. But it’s all for nothing if the team is reluctant to use the tool.\n",
      "In this short video, you’ll learn some best practices on motivating and training your team on using Wrike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kick-off team meeting\n",
      "When inviting your team to the workspace, schedule a meeting to introduce your team to Wrike to explain the importance of the launch.\n",
      "Be open to feedback and answer any questions and objections during this meeting. If you need help, you can forward the questions to our support team or turn to our consultants for custom Wrike deployment. It’s a good idea to record this session to share with missing team members and future newcomers.\n",
      "Here are some main questions to cover:\n",
      "1. “What’s in it for me?” This is one of the main questions to cover to prove the value of Wrike. You need to make it clear for each team member how Wrike will help them in their daily activities compared to previously used tools like emails and spreadsheets. Share the intent behind deploying Wrike and some thoughts on its impact on your processes.\n",
      "Our clients often list these benefits (but try to identify values unique for your team):\n",
      "\n",
      "Better visibility (you can clearly see who is working on what)\n",
      "Fewer status update meetings (no need to chase each other with status update questions)\n",
      "Less chaos overall (no more “latest file version” quests or “it was not approved” battles\n",
      "Eliminate duplicate work\n",
      "Save time on searching for task details and discussions in long email threads\n",
      "\n",
      "2. “How does Wrike work?” The good news is that not everyone needs to be a Wrike expert. Although managers will definitely need to learn more advanced Wrike features, most of the team will do great if they learn the basics of Wrike:\n",
      "\n",
      "The four building blocks. Understanding the differences between spaces, folders, projects, and tasks will help your team easily navigate Wrike and find the information they need.\n",
      "Where to find their work. Work is located in their Inbox and personal dashboard.\n",
      "How to start a project. Yes, everyone needs that — not just managers. Any initiative that requires collaboration and includes a deliverable and a due date is a project.\n",
      "How to provide access to work data. It’s important to understand sharing, following, and assigning and when to use what.\n",
      "How to communicate with the team. Adding comments with @mentions will ensure everyone is on the same page.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve prepared this handout with these concepts properly explained.\n",
      "3. “Where can I learn more?” We offer learning paths for each role in all our educational materials, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "Interactive courses in Wrike Discover\n",
      "Guides on getting started\n",

      "Best practices for managers and team members\n",
      "\n",
      "Inviting your team to Wrike\n",
      "Now you’re ready to invite users to your account. The easiest way is to click the “Add users” button at the bottom of your workspace. You can also invite users in the account management tab or by clicking \"Add Assignee\" or “Shared with” icons.\n",
      "In your account management tab, you can specify the user role:\n",
      "\n",
      "When you’re inviting team members to your account, make them regular users.\n",
      "When you’re involving external stakeholders (such as clients or contributors from other teams) who will be offering input and will collaborate extensively with you, make them external users.\n",
      "When you’re inviting external stakeholders (such as freelancers or executives) who need to view your team’s work and comment on it, make them collaborators.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next step is to grant admin rights to your account champions. Admins on Business and Enterprise subscriptions can create user groups to manage users more efficiently.\n",
      "Important: Your team will only see work items shared with them. So don’t forget to grant your team access to spaces, folders, and projects when you invite them. Learn more about granting access to information.\n",
      "Onboarding newcomers\n",
      "Even if your team knows all ins and outs of Wrike, newcomers may feel lost in the beginning. Here are a few ways to make them feel comfortable:\n",
      "\n",
      "Create a presentation tailored to why and how your team uses Wrike (or use the recording of the kick-off meeting for your team).\n",

      "Assign a Wrike buddy. Pair new employees with a Wrike expert on your team who can help them get started and answer questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your team welcomes new members quite often, it would be beneficial to create an onboarding template project or blueprint. Fill it with useful links and rules of using Wrike and duplicate it for each new team member.\n"

      "change\n",
      "Change Management\n",
      "Many people prefer staying in their comfort zone as opposed to accepting new habits. It means that your team might be resistant to a new tool that requires a significant change in their work behavior.\n",
      "To deal with this challenge, we suggest you to follow the “Rider-Elephant-Path” model described by Dan and Chip Heath in their famous book “Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard:”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rider represents our rational system that analyzes, plans, and solves problems.\n",
      "The Elephant is our emotional system that’s easily spooked and hates doing things without immediate benefits.\n",
      "The Path is an external environment that influences chances to accept the change. The Elephant usually follows the path where it meets the least resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "To help your team get on board, you need to work with all three elements: Direct the rider, motivate the elephant, and shape the path.\n",
      "Direct the Rider\n",
      "Point to the destination\n",
      "Change is easier when you know where you’re going and why it’s worth it. Create a “destination postcard” that’s clear to the Rider (rational reasons) and appealing to the Elephant (the emotional reasons). The SMART goals may come in handy here. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of this quarter, no projects managed in Wrike will be overdue.\n",
      "Next quarter we’ll increase the number of completed projects by 30%.\n",
      "By the end of this year, 99% of client communication will be moved to Wrike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Script the critical moves\n",
      "Break down the path to the destination into small, actionable steps and provide crystal clear instructions for what to do on each step. This will help the Rider escape decision paralysis: When presented with different options, they’ll prefer the default one. For example, your team members may doubt if they need to create a task or project in Wrike to launch a new initiative. They may end up sending email as they did before.\n",
      "The solution is to create a “Rules of Wrike” playbook describing the details of using Wrike: “When you start working on the task, change its status to ‘In Progress’” or “If you have a question for the task owner, leave a comment in the task and @mention the task owner.”\n",
      "Follow the bright spots\n",
      "Focus on what’s already working well instead of existing problems:\n",
      "\n",
      "Highlight the first small wins achieved with Wrike’s help:\n",
      "\n",
      "First project launched\n",
      "Number of completed tasks\n",
      "New discussions in Wrike comments\n",

      "Share examples of other teams that successfully adopted Wrike:\n",

      "Airbnb’s team scaled their processes.\n",
      "TeamViewer optimized their marketing campaigns.\n",
      "SurveyMonkey improved their project delivery.\n",
      "Exploding Kittens bridged the gap between collaboration and creativity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Motivate the Elephant\n",
      "Find the feeling\n",
      "Knowing something isn’t enough to cause change. You need to make people feel something:\n",
      "\n",
      "Share your feelings: Let your team know how you personally are excited about Wrike and your thoughts on Wrike’s value.\n",
      "Gamify the process to make it fun and reward the champions: Run the “Wriker of the Month” contest to celebrate the team member who completed the most tasks. Or try “a day without email challenge” when your team spends one working day using Wrike instead of sending emails to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shrink the change\n",
      "Break down the change until it no longer spooks the Elephant. “Let’s move all our work to Wrike” may feel like a bit too much work to do. Try to lower the bar first and help your team to make the first step.\n",
      "For example, you may start by launching one simple project in Wrike such as “Organize a Team-Building Party,” assign tasks, and let your team collaborate on it. This way your team may get a taste of Wrike quickly and celebrate the success during the party.\n",
      "Grow your people\n",
      "Cultivate a sense of identity and instill the growth mindset. One option is to make Wrike the competitive advantage for your team, because it makes them more efficient and tech-savvy. If your team accepts this stance, they’ll be more eager to use Wrike as it will make them feel more proud of their work.\n",
      "One of the traits of the growth mindset is to embrace failure: Listen to your team’s feedback about Wrike and analyze obstacles and roadblocks. Based on that, optimize the way you’re using Wrike.\n",
      "Shape the Path\n",
      "Tweak the environment\n",
      "The Elephant tends to follow the path with least resistance. Optimized environments with minimum obstacles enforce the right behavior and prevent bad habits. Here are some tips to make the journey easier:\n",
      "\n",
      "Optimize the account setup so it’s easy to navigate and find working items. Learn how. \n",
      "Make it easy to learn Wrike:\n",
      "\n",
      "Share help resources and step-by-step guides.\n",
      "Organize relevant training and “lunch and learns.”\n",
      "Launch peer support groups or Wrike buddy programs (especially useful for teams with 10+ members).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide an easy and transparent way to handle feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Build habits\n",
      "When behavior is habitual, it doesn’t require any effort from the Rider. The habit of using Wrike on a daily basis is essential for your success with the tool. If your team doesn’t report on updates, you’ll lack important insight into work progress. We collected the checklist with useful Wrike habits in the next section.\n",
      "Look for ways to encourage habits:\n",
      "\n",
      "Piggyback a new habit on another one: For example, use Wrike Gmail integration, extension for Adobe \n",
      "Creative Cloud, or Slack integration.\n",
      "Set action triggers by frequently asking your team:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did you check your Wrike Inbox?”\n",
      "“Did you create a task for that?”\n",
      "“Did you upload the agreement to Wrike?”\n",

      "\n",
      "Take a stance: “If it’s not in Wrike, it doesn’t exist.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Rally the group\n",
      "Behavior is contagious. Help it spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "Build a sense of “acceptable behavior.” For example, announce that all incoming work received via request forms will get a bit higher priority than work received through other channels.\n",
      "Lead by example: Use Wrike in your daily work, present team dashboards on your team meetings, and ask work questions in Wrike comments instead of messengers.\n",

      "Overview\n",
      "Remote work may be a company policy by choice or necessity, but it can become a competitive advantage for a team. The trick is to leverage benefits (like flexible working schedules or work-life balance) and overcome challenges (such as miscommunication, distractions, or lack of human interaction).\n",

      "Team Efficiency\n",
      "1. Keep in touch\n",
      "Schedule regular syncs\n",
      "When working remotely, it’s harder to receive feedback and feel connected. Make sure everyone feels included in the everyday life and work of the group.\n",
      "Depending on your team’s type of work and habits, run regular, short syncs:\n",
      "\n",
      "Short daily “stand-ups” (in Slack, Zoom, or in Wrike comment fields) to share highlights and roadblocks\n",

      "Monthly cross-department meetings to keep all stakeholders in the loop\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a good idea to review the Team Dashboard, your project’s Gantt chart, and/or Project Status Reports during such meetings for better visibility into work progress.\n",
      "Uplevel virtual meetings\n",
      "Moving from face-to-face meetings to online conferencing may require some effort. Our main tips here are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Cameras on! Video adds human touch to online meetings. You can use tools like Zoom or Skype.\n",
      "Bring everyone into the discussion by asking for each team member’s opinion. Although it’s a good idea to mute all attendees by default for larger meetings, make sure no one’s kept muted or left out during the entire meeting. Use built-in capabilities of online conference tools like “raise your hand” or “Q&A box” and teach your team about these possibilities.\n",
      "Respect schedules and time differences. Check attendees’ online calendars or send them messages if needed to ask about their availability. When in doubt about time differences, use time zone converters.\n",
      "Share a meeting agenda in advance, keep track of discussed action items and add the summary of discussed topics and decisions to the Wrike task.\n",

      "\n",
      "Proactively share and overcommunicate\n",
      "In a remote team, it’s easier to lose grip of actual workload, work progress, and priorities, so questions like, “Who’s responsible for this task?” or “What's the latest agreement version?” quickly become a part of daily work. That’s why the habit of proactive sharing lays a background for efficient virtual collaboration:\n",
      "\n",
      "Update the task status when you start working on it.\n",
      "Ask questions in task comments.\n",
      "@mention key stakeholders to communicate updates.\n",
      "Request a status update if you need to remind someone about a task or ask about work progress.\n",
      "Create tasks with clear titles and detailed descriptions.\n",
      "Reschedule tasks if needed and explain the reasons in task comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that it’s better to overcommunicate than to skip important details.\n",
      "Learn best practices on organizing work-related communication.\n",
      "Keep stakeholders in the loop\n",
      "Keeping in touch with external and internal clients to report updates and discuss issues is essential for remote work success. One tip is to spark your communication with more details that will give your stakeholders a better understanding of the process and not only of the results. For instance, give a brief overview not only on what was achieved, but how, what interesting observations were made, etc. For better visibility, share external links and snapshots as monitoring and feedback tools.\n",
      "If you need a deeper level of communication with your stakeholders, consider inviting them as collaborators (or external users if necessary) and add them as followers of projects or tasks, so they won’t miss any updates.\n",
      "Learn more about how to build trust with your clients.\n",
      "2. Well-defined work processes are the backbone for productivity\n",
      "Explain ground rules\n",
      "Everyone on the team should clearly understand the ground rules of remote collaborations such as schedule flexibilities, work processes, and performance metrics. Make sure your team knows each other's roles and responsibilities.\n",
      "Communicating these expectations and sharing best practices on remote collaboration will help your team feel more confident. Make this information easily accessible for your team at any time. For example, create a knowledge base folder in Wrike with tips and tricks for remote work and share it with your team.\n",
      "Ensure a single source of truth\n",
      "Make Wrike a central hub for all work-related information. Avoid getting things done via emails and spreadsheets as much as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "Launch all upcoming initiatives as projects in Wrike. Don’t forget to use the six rules of an efficient project launch.\n",
      "Keep all the task discussion and latest file versions attached to relevant tasks and projects to avoid losing info in long email threads.\n",
      "Create dashboards to monitor work progress.\n",
      "Create a report on project statuses, schedule regular report reminders, and share report snapshots with management showing what was accomplished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Streamline work intake\n",
      "Avoid receiving requests from multiple channels – they often miss important details and are difficult to track and prioritize. The solution is to set up a simple Wrike request form to structure incoming work. If you’re working with external stakeholders, give them the link to this request.\n",

      "3. Encouraging team spirit\n",
      "Create a fun zone\n",
      "Informal communication plays an important role in building team spirit. Replace face-to-face chats with a virtual watercooler where your team members can discuss their personal lives as well as work issues. Here are some ideas for inspiration:\n",

      "Overview\n",
      "Remote work may be a company policy by choice or necessity, but it can become a competitive advantage for a team. The trick is to leverage benefits (like flexible working schedules or work-life balance) and overcome challenges (such as miscommunication, distractions, or lack of human interaction).\n",
      "Here are some best practices to help you make remote work more productive.\n",
      "Personal Productivity https://help.wrike.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046406233-Step-4-Work-from-Home-Productively#personal\n",
      "personal\n",
      "Personal Productivity\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Organize your workspace\n",
      "Create a dedicated office space\n",
      "In the same way you set boundaries between your work and home life, you also need to keep your office and personal spaces separate. Set up your workspace at a table or desk rather than a sofa or bed. You’ll get more work done, and it’s less likely that you’ll get sleepy. Find a clean, quiet, isolated workspace so you can work on your tasks in peace. Get inspired with our Wrikers’ home offices on Instagram.\n",
      "Minimize distractions\n",
      "Keeping focus on your tasks may be challenging when you work from home. In addition to common office work distractions such as phone and social media, you get a bonus in terms of kids and pets.\n",
      "Share responsibility for young kids with your partner: Create a shared calendar so you can keep track of conference calls and take turns caring for your children. Consider having serious conversations about your work importance with older children.\n",
      "One Wriker said, “My office has a door, and it's not for knocking. When the door is closed, it's like daddy has got in his car and left for the office.” Even a simple “Don’t Disturb” Post-It note on the door can help. Read more tips about working from home with children in our blogpost.\n",
      "2. Maintain work-life balance\n",
      "Stick to your schedule\n",
      "Remote work often implies a flexible schedule. It allows you to experiment with your working time and align your schedule with your high productivity period. On the other hand, flexible schedules often result in unconscious overworking.\n",
      "The trick here is to separate time for home and work (e.g., make appointments right after you finish work). You need to clearly set start and finish time for your work and communicate it both to your team and your family. You can set up your working hours in Google Calendar or Slack.\n",
      "And, of course, commit to following it yourself! After your work time is over, close your laptop and do your personal stuff without checking your email or work notifications.\n",
      "Prioritize your work\n",
      "Limit the number of tasks you include in your daily plan. For example, list out three must-do tasks and three optional tasks. Estimate time needed to complete your tasks to make sure you set realistic plans and don’t overwork. Then make sure that task list in My to-do or your personal dashboard reflects your plan in terms of deadlines and priorities.\n",
      "Here’s one more great tip from the Wrike community: Keep yourself accountable. Agree to have a 15-minute call/video chat at the beginning of your day and read your to-do lists to each other. It doesn't matter if they're in the same service as you or even in the same company!\n",
      "3. Follow healthy routines\n",
      "Morning routines\n",
      "Start your day as if you’re going to the office: Fix your bed, eat a good breakfast, dress nicely, and do your other pre-work routines so you can feel the rhythm of office life.\n",
      "As you enter your home office and start your work day, visit your Inbox to check new updates and assignments. Then plan your day in My to-do and update tasks statuses, attach files, and leave comments with @mentions as you go. It will make your morning positive and productive! Learn more about daily routines.\n",
      "Productivity methods\n",
      "To get more things done in less time and with less stress, try to use one of these proven time management systems:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pomodoro: Break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks.\n",
      "80/20 rule: Focus on 20% of top tasks in your to-do list that will have the highest impact on your goal.\n",
      "Two minutes rule: If the task takes you less than two minutes to complete, do it right away even if it’s not really important or urgent. If it requires more of your time, defer or delegate it.\n",
      "Eat the frog: Do your most important or scariest task first in the morning so you don’t have to think about it for the rest of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking breaks with purpose\n",
      "Regular breaks throughout the day is a great way to recharge your batteries. Try to set reminders in a way that fits your schedule and work habits. And spend your breaks productively! Get away from your desk and move for at least five minutes every hour. Check out this infographic, “The Science of Productive Breaks.”\n",

The chart can include multiple values on both the X and Y-axis.\\nBar Chart: Use Bar Chart to compare many items. You can see descriptive data (e.g. categories or items) along the Y-Axis and values displayed on the X-Axis.\\nLine Chart: Use Line Chart to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group or category.\\nArea Chart: This one is very similar to the Line Chart except that the areas under each line are colored, and it is possible to display them as stacked.\\nTable: Table widget displays a broader view of your data, presenting it in columns.\\nTree Map: The Tree Map is a multi-dimensional widget that displays hierarchical data in the form of nested rectangles.\\nScatter Map: Use Scatter Maps to visualize geographical data as data points on a map. The map distinguishes data using different colors and sizes for the data points on the map.\\nArea Map: Area Map shows the locations of data, selected for the widget.\\nIndicator: The Indicator widget provides various options for displaying one or two numeric values as a number, gauge or ticker. It also provides the option to add additional titles and a color-coded indicator icon representing the value.\\nScatter Chart: The Scatter Chart displays the distribution of two variables on an X-Axis, Y-Axis, and two additional dimensions of data that are shown as colored circles scattered across the chart.\\nCalendar Heatmap: Use the Calendar Heatmap widget to visualize values over days in a calendar-like view.\\nSunburst: The Sunburst widget is similar to a Pie Chart but is multi-dimensional. Whereas a pie chart combines one field and one numeric value, the Sunburst widget can display multiple rings, one for each field.\\nBox & Whisker Plot: Box Plots are divided into four quartiles. The middle quartiles are represented by a box that contains 50% of the data and the median value. The upper and lower quartiles contain the maximum and minimum values and the remaining 50% of the data. These quartiles are represented by lines called whiskers.\\nPolar Chart: Use the Polar Chart to compare multiple categories/variables with a spacial perspective.\\nFunnel Chart: Funnel Chart is a common way to show stages in a process, with the most prevalent example being a funnel representing stages in a sales process.\\n',\n",

This way all users who have access to the projects will know exactly which talent is required to complete them.\\nSet effort that’s required to finish each task within the projects and define tasks’ start and end dates This lets you get an overview of how much time employees will need to finish the tasks and over which period of time.\\nCreate or open an existing Workload chart to distribute tasks among employees. Workload chart shows employees’ current workload, so you can easily determine which of them have enough time to finish the tasks that you are about to assign to them. Tip! Create a separate workload chart for each group of employees with the same job role. It’ll be easier to see the workload of all available employees before assigning tasks to them.\\nSet the horizontal backlog box in the Workload chart to show all tasks from the projects that need staffing. Tasks in the box are automatically grouped by job role and project.\\nAll that’s left is to assign tasks to users. Once you match the task that is assigned to a certain job role with the actual user who has that job role allocated to them, the job role will disappear from the list of assignees automatically.\\n\\nJob Roles vs. User Groups\\nUser groups make sharing data and notifying large groups of account users easier. The purpose of job roles, on the other hand, is to help you clearly define which talent you will require to perform tasks.  That’s why, unlike user groups, job roles can be added as task assignees. At the same time, when you assign a task to a job role, users with this role don’t get any notifications, and they don’t automatically get access to the task. This way you can plan projects without distracting your employees with unnecessary @mentions. However, later you can group all tasks assigned to a certain job role on the Workload chart and distribute them among your employees while also confirming that they have enough time to successfully finish the tasks.',\n",

       "  'Edit Task Details via Email\\nEmail integration allows you to do more than just create tasks, you can edit or add various task details right from your email:\\n\\nAssign a task\\nShare a task\\nAdd attachments\\nScheduling a task\\nUpdate or add a task\\'s status\\nModify task importance\\n\\nPlease note: 1) You cannot update a task\\'s description field via email 2) Emails with empty subject lines don\\'t trigger task updates.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAssign a Task via Email\\nTo assign a task to specific users simply include their email addresses in the “To” field.\\nTo reassign a task, include the new assignee’s email address in the “To” field and add “FW:” to the beginning of the subject line.\\n\\n\\n\\nShare a Task\\nWhen creating a task via email, the task is shared with the email recipients as well as with the people who are already\\xa0shared on the folder where the task is added. When a task is added to an existing Wrike folder, the users that follow the folder receive a notification about the newly created task.\\nYou can share a task with additional members\\xa0of your Wrike account by adding their email addresses in the “CC:” field.\\nIf email recipients are shared on the folder that a task is added to, then the task is automatically shared with them.\\xa0However, you can prevent a task from being shared with other email recipients (who the folder is not already shared with) by adding their email address in the email’s “BCC” field.\\nAdd Attachments\\nIf you include file or image attachments in your email, they will appear in that task’s list of attached files in Wrike.\\n\\n\\n\\nScheduling a Task\\nIf you do not add any dates in the email subject line, then, the task is processed according to your profile settings and set either as backlogged or planned for today. If your settings are set to create one-day tasks by default, you can still schedule backlogged tasks by adding [backlogged] in the subject line.\\nYou can also schedule a task for specific dates by adding the start date and due date to the email’s subject line. Make sure to put the start and end dates in MM/DD format (or DD/MM depending on your date format settings) and surround the dates with brackets: [MM/DD-MM/DD]. The task will automatically be scheduled for the current year, but you can also schedule a task for a future year. To do this use the format: [MM/DD/YY-MM/DD/YY] or [DD/MM/YYYY-DD/MM/YYYY] depending on your date format settings).\\nTo reschedule a task, make sure your email contains RE: in the subject line and then use the following format to specify the start and due date: [MM/DD-MM/DD] (or DD/MM if you set another date format in your account).\\nPlease note,\\xa0if you choose the option “1-day task scheduled\\xa0for\\xa0today” from the \"Type of Tasks\" section of the email addresses\\xa0tab\\xa0of your Wrike Profile, then tasks created via email are automatically assigned to the person who sent them.\\n\\n\\n\\nTask Status\\nIf you do not specify statuses for tasks sent via email, then they are created as active by default. For Business and Enterprise users, if a task’s status is not specified (and the task is created in a folder with a Custom Workflow) then the task is assigned the first active status from that Custom Workflow.\\nTo change or specify a task status, just add the desired status (in brackets) into the subject line of your email. If you want to use a custom status include “CS:” before typing your status name. For example: [CS:New]. Please note that the default statuses* are not case sensitive, but Custom Statuses are. When you add the task status “completed” via email, then the task is automatically marked as completed in Wrike.\\n*For accounts created prior to 12/20/2016 the default statuses are: completed, active, deferred, and cancelled. For accounts created after that date the default statuses are: new, in progress, completed, on hold, cancelled)\\n\\n\\n\\nTask Importance\\nWrike gives tasks created via email the same importance as the priority of the email, so you can change the priority of your email to update the task’s importance.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \"Email a Comment to an Existing Task\\nThere are several ways to send a comment to an existing task:\\n\\nIf you received any notification emails about the task, just reply to the notification email and keep wrike@wrike.com (or wrike+taskID@wrike.com) among the recipients. Wrike’s Intelligent Email Engine™ cuts out signatures and repeating text and adds only your message as a comment.\\nIn case there is an email you would like to forward to a task and add its contents as a comment, send it to wrike@wrike.com and put Re: [Folder Name] Task title in the subject line 1. Once Wrike receives an email that contains Re: in the subject line, it searches for the task by title and adds your comment from the email body to the activity stream of the task. If several tasks with the same name are found within the specified folder, you will get an email about this conflict. If Wrike can’t find your task in the folder you mention it will try searching your entire workspace for a matching task.\\nThe other way to add a comment to an existing task is by sending an email to the task’s unique email address 2. In this case, Wrike locates the task by its ID which means that you don’t need to worry about specifying the correct folder path in the subject line (but you do need to have some text in the subject line, a comment won't be added if the subject line is completely empty).\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  'Advanced Features\\nEmail a Task to a Subfolder\\nYou can email a task to a subfolder just like you would email it to a folder. If you have several subfolders with the same name, provide the folder path to put the task in the right place. To create a folder path just list\\xa0all parent folders, separating each with slashes, and put brackets around the list.\\n\\n\\n\\nEmail a Task to Several Folders\\nTo do this, list all the folder names you would like to include the task in, separate\\xa0the folder names with commas, and make sure to include square brackets around the folder list. Unless you specify a status, the task’s workflow is taken from the first folder in the list.\\n\\n\\n\\nCreate a Milestone Task\\nInstead of including start and due date, specify only the due date : [MM/DD].\\nTag a Colleague in a Comment via Email\\nIn most cases @mentioning cannot be done when sending a comment to Wrike via email. However, if someone @mentions you, and you reply via email, then your response is\\xa0posted as a comment in Wrike and the person who @mentioned you is automatically @mentioned in your comment.',\n",

Required headers are: key, title, status, priority, assigned to, start date, duration, end date, depends on, and description. The columns can be empty, but the required headers should be filled in on the top.\\xa01\\n\\nRemember to add a key number for each new row. It has to be unique, but there is no specific order required\\xa02\\n\\n\\nFor Business and Enterprise users: to add Custom statuses via Excel you should add a \"Workflow\" column to the left of the \"Status\" column and a \"Custom Status\" column to the right of the \"Status\" column.\\nFor users on Wrike for Professional Services accounts and accounts with Wrike Resource add-on: to import effort, add an \"Effort\" column anywhere before the \"Description\" column in your excel file.\\n',\n",
       "  'Add Data to XLS Files\\nDirectly from within your XLS file you can:\\n\\nCreate a Folder or Project\\nCreate a Subfolder\\nCreate a Task\\nCreate a Milestone Task\\nInclude a Task in Several Folders\\nCreate Subtasks\\nAdd a Task Description\\nAdd a Task Status\\nCreate a Dependency\\n\\nPlease remember, each row should have a unique number in the “Key” column.\\nCreate a Folder or Project\\n\\nIn the “Title” column (of an empty row) type in the preferred name for your folder or project.\\nInclude forward slashes before and after the folder/project name. For example: /folder name/.\\xa01\\nFor projects: specify a project status in the \"Status\" column. To add custom project status, add a column called \"Default task workflow\" prior to the column \"Title\" and add the name of the workflow in front of the project’s name. Make sure to fill in the “Custom workflow” cell and the “Custom Status” cell accordingly.\\n\\nNote! Currently only Business and Enterprise accounts created after 4/15/2019 have Custom Workflows for projects.\\nCreate a Subfolder\\nIn a new row, click the cell in the corresponding “Title” column, type the parent folder’s name (with slashes before and after the name), followed by the title of your subfolder. For example: /folder name/subfolder name.\\xa02\\nCreate a Task\\nAdding a task in Excel is easy: just enter the task’s title in the “Title” column. Then use the other columns to enter any additional information you would like to specify about the task 3. If you would like to create your task within a folder: first create the folder (per steps above), then add the task in a row immediately beneath the folder\\'s row.\\n\\nAdd start and end dates for the tasks using the slash symbol as a separator (for example: 23/10/2019) . The duration is calculated automatically, based on start and end dates. The end date is calculated automatically when you add the start date and duration. If the start and end dates are in place and you manually add the duration, which is more than the automatically calculated duration, the end date will be shifted after the import and will be adjusted to fit the duration.\\nCreate a Milestone Task\\nEnter the task’s title in the “Title” column. Add a date in the \"End Date\" column, but leave the \"Start Date\" column empty. Then use the other columns to enter any additional information pertaining to the task.\\nInclude a Task in Several Folders\\nTo include a task in several folders, begin by adding your task to one folder. Then, to include the task in an additional folder, simply copy the entire row with the task information (including the key number) and paste it beneath another folder.\\xa01\\nCreate Subtasks\\nAdd data as you normally would for a task and then add the parent task\\'s name in the \"Parent Task\" column. The parent task must appear in the file before the subtask.\\xa02  If you would like to create a subtask of the subtask, the entire task path has to be specified in the “Parent task” column.\\nNote! In order to perform XLS import, the parent task and subtask cannot have the same name. There should be at least one symbol of difference.\\nAdd a Task Description\\nAdd your description in the “Description” field. Data entered there is added to the description section of the task in Wrike.\\xa03\\n\\nAdd a task Status\\nAdd a status to a task by typing one of the default statuses in a task’s “Status” column 1. For accounts created before 12/20/2016 the default statuses are: active, completed, deferred and cancelled. For accounts created after 12/20/2016 the default statuses are new, in progress, on hold, completed and cancelled.\\nBusiness and Enterprise users have the option to add a Custom Status to a task. First, go to the task row where you would like to add the custom status, type in the custom workflow’s name in the “Workflow” column\\xa02 and then type the desired status in the “Custom Status” column 3. If the Custom status or workflow cannot be found upon import, then a status from the default workflow will be applied.\\n\\nCreate a Dependency\\nA dependency between two tasks can be created by using the “Depends On” column 1. Go to the row of the task for which you would like to add a dependency and, in the “Depends On” column, enter the key number of the task\\xa02 on which the current task will be dependent. In the same cell (without any spaces) add one of our dependency codes 3. For example, your “Depends On” cell might look like this: 5FS. If you want to add several dependencies, separate them using a comma and space (for example: 22SS, 32FS). Lastly, add start and end dates for the task in the appropriate columns (or only an end date if the task is a milestone).\\nAccepted dependency codes:\\n\\nFS – the dependent task starts when the predecessor task finishes\\nSS* – the dependent task starts when the predecessor task starts\\nFF – the dependent task finishes when the predecessor task finishes\\nSF* – the dependent task finishes when the predecessor task starts\\n\\n* The dependency type is not applicable to Milestone tasks\\n\\nPlease note, upon import to Wrike, dependent tasks are automatically rescheduled to start as early as possible without breaking the dependencies. However, you can delay some dependent tasks by specifying their preferred start dates in the start date constraints column. Dependencies do not affect dates of milestones and if the dependency that includes a milestone causes a conflict, it will be highlighted in red on the Gantt Chart after the import.',\n",
